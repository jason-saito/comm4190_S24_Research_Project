# Welcome to my research project! 

My name is Jason Saito and I am a current student in COMM 4190 (Talking With AI: Computational And Communication Approaches).

Through this project, I will examine sports analytics in a communicative context and explore whether and how LLMs might be used to assist sports scouting and game analysts.

The "Data" folder of the repository contains data that I prompted Gemini 1.5 Pro with. This data is referenced through out the "Exploring_LLMs.ipynb" notebook.

The "Files" folder of the repository contains a scouting report that was referenced in the "Exploring_LLMs.ipynb" notebook.
