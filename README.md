# Welcome! 
Welcome to my research project! 

My name is Jason and I am a current student in COMM 4190 (Talking With AI: Computational And Communication Approaches).

Through this repo, you will be able to learn more about the intersections of Sports Analytics and Large Language Models (LLMs). I aim to explain what Sports Analytics is, how Sports Analysts can use LLMs, and its implications.
