# Welcome to my research project! 

My name is Jason and I am a current student in COMM 4190 (Talking With AI: Computational And Communication Approaches).

Through this repository, you will be able to learn more about the intersections of Sports Analysts and Large Language Models (LLMs). Through out this project, I hope to examine sports analytics as a communicative context and explore whether and how LLMs might be used to assist sports scouting and game analysts.
