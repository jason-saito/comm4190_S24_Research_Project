    "It seems that there is some improvements being made to the interactions of LLMs with basketball and sports analytics. Specifically, they're aiming to fix the issues associatied with Natural Language Generation (NLG) and creating basketball game summaries<cite id=\"wg2p9\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>.\n",

    "The paper points to the current resources available and how these datasets lack the data needed for generating summaries using advanced data analytics. A useful resource that exists is called the \"Rotowire and Rotowire-FG datasets.<cite id=\"stqoj\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>\" These datasets contain game summaries, box scores, and statistics to supplement the game summaries. While they contain a large amount of data there are some limitations to these datasets <cite id=\"o333t\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>.\n",
