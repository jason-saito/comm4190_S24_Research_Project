    "### SportQA: A Benchmark to Improve LLM Understanding of Sports\n",
    "SportQA aims to help LLMs gain a better understanding in sports knowledge. Through their research, they hope to allow LLMs to answer more complicated problems about sports rather than simply fact-based questions<cite id=\"nwj4g\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FA7PNLSS5\">(Xia et al., 2024)</a></cite>. Specifically, SportsQA is a large dataset that was created to test an LLM's knowledge of sports by often shuffling players from various sports and plays from different sports to see if the LLM can really understand sports<cite id=\"zg6t9\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FA7PNLSS5\">(Xia et al., 2024)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset there are three different types of questions. The first is \"foundational knowledge\" that assesses the LLM's basic understanding of sports and focuses more on fact-based questions. The second type is \"rules and tactics comprehension,\" this involves asking the LLM to understand sports rules and strategies. The last type is \"advanced scenario-based understanding,\" these questions ask the LLM to analyze real sports situations<cite id=\"kuchd\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FA7PNLSS5\">(Xia et al., 2024)</a></cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "From asking the LLMs these questions, SportsQA hopes to establish a benchmark for testing an LLMs understanding of sports. Overall, their founds showed that the models show promise for understanding facts, rules, and foundational knowledge in sports, but their skills in complicated sports questions is still very limited. Their findings show the need for greater research in Natural Language Processing and Artifical Intelligence to allow LLMs to have a better understanding of sports. \n",

    "### SportsSett: A Solution to Sports and Natural Language Generation\n",
    "It seems that there are some improvements being made to the interactions of LLMs with basketball and sports analytics. Specifically, they're aiming to fix the issues associated with Natural Language Generation (NLG) and creating basketball game summaries<cite id=\"wg2p9\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper points to the current resources available and how these datasets lack the data needed for generating summaries using advanced data analytics. A useful resource that exists is called the \"Rotowire and Rotowire-FG datasets.<cite id=\"stqoj\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>\" These datasets contain game summaries, box scores, and statistics to supplement the game summaries. While they contain a large amount of data, there are some limitations to these datasets <cite id=\"o333t\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many issues with these two datasets. The proposed solution is a new dataset called \"SportsSett.\" This dataset stores game statistics in a hierarchal structure, which allows the data to be queried from multiple dimensions. This structure will help allow for a richer \"entity-relationship graph <cite id=\"vnj2p\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C17220151%2FUWYAU6PB\">(Thomson et al., 2020)</a></cite>.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Existing Issues with Rotowire and Rotowire-FG\n",
    "The researchers who created SportsSett explained that there are issues with the existing Rotowire and Rotowire-FG datasets in terms of the data structure, availability, and length. In addition, the dataset lacks data on playoff games and preseason games. SportsSett seeks to solve these issues through data cleaning and redesign of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SportsSett database hopes to also expand upon the data by adding information such as stadium name and location. This is because, in basketball, home-court advantage and constant traveling can have very real effects on NBA teams. \n",

      "abstract": "A deep understanding of sports, a field rich in strategic and dynamic content, is crucial for advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP). This holds particular significance in the context of evaluating and advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), given the existing gap in specialized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SportQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs in the context of sports understanding. SportQA encompasses over 70,000 multiple-choice questions across three distinct difficulty levels, each targeting different aspects of sports knowledge from basic historical facts to intricate, scenario-based reasoning tasks. We conducted a thorough evaluation of prevalent LLMs, mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Our results reveal that while LLMs exhibit competent performance in basic sports knowledge, they struggle with more complex, scenario-based sports reasoning, lagging behind human expertise. The introduction of SportQA marks a significant step forward in NLP, offering a tool for assessing and enhancing sports understanding in LLMs.",
