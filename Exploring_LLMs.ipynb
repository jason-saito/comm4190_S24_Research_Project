    "### My Exploration\n",
    "Through out this section, I will be exploring how LLMs can be used in the context of scouting analytics. Specfically I will be walking the Gemini 1.5 Pro model through the scenario of an NBA draft. In this scenario I will be using Gemini 1.5 Pro to conduct video analysis, player evaluation, and generating reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through out the exploration we will be telling the LLM that it is a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers back in 2017. They will be determining what player they would like to pick with the first pick of the 2017 NBA draft. In real life, this is also true, as the Philadelphia 76ers traded up to the first pick. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Data for Draft Analysis\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Continue to pretend that you are a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers. You have the first pick in the 2017 NBA draft this year. Conduct an in-depth analysis of all three of these players and explain which of the three you would like to draft. \n",

    "**Response:**\n",
    "> Evaluating Three Top Prospects for the 76ers\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Based on the provided information, the three players under consideration appear to be:\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 1: Markelle Fultz (Washington, Guard)\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 2: Lonzo Ball (UCLA, Guard)\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 3: Jayson Tatum (Duke, Forward)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Let's dive into a deeper analysis of each player, comparing their strengths and weaknesses to determine the best fit for the Philadelphia 76ers with the first pick in the 2017 NBA Draft.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 1: Markelle Fultz\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Strengths: Fultz is the most well-rounded offensive player of the three. He boasts impressive scoring versatility, shooting efficiently from both inside and outside the arc. His 47.6% field goal percentage and 41.3% three-point percentage showcase his ability to score at all three levels. Additionally, his 5.9 assists per game highlight his playmaking skills and potential to be a primary ball-handler.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Weaknesses: His defensive stats, while decent, don't stand out as much as his offensive prowess. He averaged 1.6 steals and 1.2 blocks per game, suggesting he has the potential to be a solid defender but may need to improve his consistency and effort on that end.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 2: Lonzo Ball\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Strengths: Ball is an elite passer and floor general. His 7.6 assists per game lead the pack, demonstrating his exceptional court vision and ability to elevate his teammates. He's also a good rebounder for his position, averaging 6.0 rebounds per game, which would aid the 76ers in transition opportunities.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Weaknesses: Ball's shooting is a major concern. While his 55.1% field goal percentage looks good, his 41.2% three-point percentage is less impressive when considering his unorthodox shooting form and potential for inconsistency. His lower steals and blocks averages also raise questions about his defensive impact at the NBA level.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 3: Jayson Tatum\n",
    ">Strengths: Tatum is a gifted scorer with a knack for creating his own shot. He demonstrates impressive efficiency inside the arc with a 50.4% two-point percentage. His 84.9% free throw percentage suggests a smooth shooting stroke and potential for improvement beyond the arc. Additionally, he shows promise as a defender with 1.3 steals and 1.1 blocks per game.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Weaknesses: Compared to Fultz and Ball, Tatum's playmaking is less developed, averaging only 2.1 assists per game. While he can create for himself, he might not be the ideal primary ball-handler the 76ers need.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Draft Recommendation: Markelle Fultz**\n",
    "> Considering the 76ers' need for a player who can create offense and be a cornerstone for the future, Markelle Fultz stands out as the best choice for the first pick. His well-rounded offensive skillset, shooting efficiency, and playmaking ability make him the ideal complement to Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. While his defense needs some development, his offensive potential and fit within the team outweigh this concern.\n",
    "> Ball's passing is phenomenal, but his shooting inconsistencies and potential fit issues with Simmons make him a riskier selection. Tatum's scoring prowess is impressive, but his lack of elite playmaking makes him less valuable to the 76ers' specific needs.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Therefore, I confidently recommend drafting Markelle Fultz with the first pick. His potential to be a superstar and the perfect fit alongside Simmons and Embiid make him the ideal choice to lead the 76ers to long-term success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "It was really shocking to me that the LLM knew the name of the players I provided the data for. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model was able to correctly keep track of all the statistics I told it, and described all of the players' stats correctly. This accuracy seems almost too good to be true, which makes me think that the model is relying on its internet access rather than its knowledge from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Following up with Gemini\n",
    "I then decided to ask it, how it knew the players' names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:** \n",
    "How did you know the players names, I did not provide them?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "You are absolutely right, you didn't explicitly provide the names of the players. However, based on the information you provided about their positions, heights, weights, and college statistics, I was able to make an educated guess that the players were Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Jayson Tatum. These three players were widely considered the top prospects in the 2017 NBA Draft, and their statistics align with the data you provided. I apologize if this caused any confusion. As a large language model, I am trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which allows me to make connections and inferences based on the information provided. However, I am still under development and learning to be more precise in my responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "This response checks out, but I still beleive that it is relying on its access to the internet to make these analyses and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing Searching\n",
    "To prevent the model from relying purely on the internet for its answers, I attempted to remove any possible traits that the model could use to identify the players. Thus I removed the confrence and school columns from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Evaluate three players. Pretend that you are a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers. You have the first pick in the 2017 NBA draft this year. Conduct an in-depth analysis of all three of these players and explain which of the three you would like to draft. \n",
    "Compare and contrast each players strengths and weaknesses and explain why you want to draft that prospect in specific\n",
    "You will be provided with their position, height, weight and stats from their college careers. \n",

    "**Response:**\n",
    "> 2017 NBA Draft Evaluation for the Philadelphia 76ers\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Holding the first pick in the draft, the 76ers need a player who can contribute immediately and become a cornerstone for the franchise's future. Let's analyze the three prospects:\n",
    ">Player 1:\n",
    ">Strengths: High scoring guard with a well-rounded offensive game. Efficient scorer inside the arc, decent 3-point shooter, and excellent free throw shooter. Good passer and rebounder for his position.\n",
    ">Weaknesses: 3-point shooting consistency is a concern. Turnover rate is a bit high. Played against weaker competition (lower SOS).\n",
    ">Summary: Player 1 has the potential to be a lead scorer in the NBA, but his outside shooting and decision-making need improvement.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Player 2:\n",
    ">Strengths: Tall guard with excellent size and scoring ability. Highly efficient scorer both inside and outside the arc. Good rebounder and passer. Plays with good pace and control.\n",
    ">Weaknesses: Free throw percentage could be better. Doesn't generate many steals or blocks.\n",
    ">Summary: Player 2 is a skilled scorer with great size for his position. He projects as a high-level combo guard with the potential to be a star.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 3:\n",
    ">Strengths: Versatile forward with good size and athleticism. Efficient scorer around the basket, decent shooter from mid-range, and an excellent free throw shooter. Good rebounder and defender.\n",
    ">Weaknesses: 3-point shooting needs improvement for a modern forward. Turnover rate is a bit high.\n",
    "Summary: Player 3 is a solid all-around player with the potential to be a reliable starter.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Recommendation: Draft Player 2**\n",
    "> Player 2 stands out as the best choice for the 76ers for several reasons:\n",
    "> Elite Scoring Potential: His efficiency and versatility as a scorer, both inside and outside, make him a constant threat on offense.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Size and Positional Versatility: His 6'6\" height allows him to play both guard positions, providing flexibility and matchup advantages.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Playmaking Ability: He demonstrates good court vision and passing skills, which is crucial for a lead guard.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> High Ceiling: He possesses the talent and skills to become a star player in the NBA.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">While his free throw shooting and defensive stats could improve, his strengths outweigh these concerns. Player 2 has the potential to be the franchise player the 76ers desperately need. He can contribute immediately while growing into a leader on and off the court.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Player 1 and Player 3 are both talented prospects, but they don't offer the same combination of size, scoring ability, and >playmaking as Player 2. Choosing Player 2 gives the 76ers the best chance to build a successful team for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts**\n",
    "Without the context before, the model chose a different player. Player 2 is Lonzo Ball (actual 2nd pick in the 2017 Draft) instead of Markelle Fultz (their actual 1st pick in the draft). I really like its analysis. It seems to really make good points such as strength of schedule (SOS) for the first prospect as well as the general skillsets for all the players. Overall I **really** like this response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considering Context\n",
    "A huge aspect of a scouting analyst's success is their ability to identify fit within a team. I wanted to see if the model could correctly identify this as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "Make sure to consider this player's strengths and weaknesses as well as your team's strengths and weaknesses. Do you still want to draft this player.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**\n",
    ">You're right, drafting needs to consider both the player's individual attributes AND the team's existing strengths and weaknesses. Let's re-evaluate Player 2 in the context of the 2017 Philadelphia 76ers:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**76ers Situation (2017):**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Strengths: Young, promising core with Ben Simmons (point forward), Joel Embiid (center) coming off injury, and Dario Saric.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Weaknesses: Lack of perimeter shooting, consistent scoring outside of Embiid (when healthy), and experienced ball-handling.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Player 2 Reconsidered:\n",
    ">Fits a Need: While NOT a pure shooter, his scoring versatility and size at the guard spot address the 76ers' need for another offensive weapon. He could play alongside Simmons, taking some ball-handling pressure off and creating a potent 1-2 punch.\n",
    "Potential Overlap: Both Simmons and Player 2 are at their best with the ball in their hands. While their skills are complementary, Coach Brown would need to design an offense that maximizes both players without hindering either.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Defensive Fit: The 76ers' defense is anchored by Embiid, and Simmons has the potential to be a versatile defender. Player 2's defense is more of a question mark.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Revised Decision:\n",
    ">Given the 76ers' specific needs, drafting Player 2 remains a strong option, BUT with a more cautious outlook:\n",
    "Offensive Fit is Key: The success of this pick hinges on Player 2 and Simmons meshing well offensively. If their games don't complement each other, the 76ers' spacing could suffer, limiting their offensive ceiling.\n",
    "Development is Crucial: Player 2's defense and off-ball play need work to maximize his fit. The 76ers' coaching staff would have a significant role in shaping his development.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Alternatives:\n",
    "Pure Shooter: If the 76ers prioritize perimeter shooting above all else, other prospects in the 2017 draft might be a better fit (though they might lack Player 2's star potential).\n",
    "Trade Down: Exploring a trade to acquire multiple assets or a player who's a more proven shooter could also be a viable strategy.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Conclusion:\n",
    "Drafting Player 2 is STILL a justifiable choice for the 76ers, but it comes with more risk than initially assessed. His fit with Simmons will determine his success, and his development is crucial for him to reach his full potential in Philadelphia. The 76ers should carefully weigh this decision against other options, considering both the player's talent and the team's specific needs.\n",
